For further information about the assay and reagents and to download the cell count datasets from which the metrics reported here were calculated \\(HMS LINCS Datasets [#20245 to #20251](http://lincs.hms.harvard.edu/db/datasets/)), please visit the HMS LINCS Database. As part of this LINCS Pilot Phase Joint Project, the Broad Institute LINCS Center for Transcriptomics generated [L1000 gene expression data](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE70138) for the same set of cells and perturbagens."],
