    "description": ["The Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (gCSI) [Haverty, P.M. 2016 Nature], a large-scale drug sensitivity dataset produced by the biotechnology company Genentech, presents the sensitivities of ~400 cell lines across 23 different tissue types to 16 anti-cancer drugs. Originally, this data was reported with traditional drug sensitivity metrics, but because doubling times of the cell lines were also reported, we were able to compute GR metrics. Both types of metrics are presented here, with IC50 and GR50 values capped at 31 M. We have also included calls for mutation or deletion of three cancer-related genes from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). We use these mutation and deletion calls to show examples of false positive and false negative results caused by confounding issues with growth rates [reference figures here]. Here, we have subsetted the data to only show breast cancer cell lines treated with the kinase inhibitor lapatinib. PTEN loss of function mutations are known to mediate resistance to treatment with lapatinib in breast cancer cells. As an example of a false negative result caused by the confounding of traditional dose-response metrics with growth rate, compare the sensitivity of PTEN mutated (LOF) cell lines to lapatinib with that of the PTEN wild-type cell lines using the metric of IC50 (non-significant difference) and then using the metric of GR50 (significant difference)."],
