    "description": ["The Genentech Cell Line Screening Initiative (gCSI), described in Haverty et al. (PMID: [27193678] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27193678)), is a large-scale drug sensitivity dataset produced by the biotechnology company Genentech. It presents the sensitivities of ~400 cell lines, across 23 different tissue types, to 16 anti-cancer drugs. Originally, the data were reported with traditional drug sensitivity metrics, but because doubling times of the cell lines were also reported, we were able to compute GR metrics. See Hafner et al. (2017) (PMID: [28591115] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28591115)) for details. Both types of metrics are presented here, with IC50 and GR50 values capped at 31 &mu;M. We have also included calls for mutation or deletion of three cancer-related genes from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE). We use these mutation and deletion calls to show examples of false positive and false negative results caused by confounding issues with growth rates."],
