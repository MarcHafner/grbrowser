    "description": ["The dose-dependent sensitivities of 74 nonmalignant breast and breast cancer cell lines were assayed by estimating proliferation using the CellTiter-GloÂ® assay 72 hours after treatment with each of ~100 small molecule inhibitors across a 9-point dose range. These data were collected by the laboratory of Dr. Joe Gray (Oregon Health Sciences University), and analysis of the data using traditional growth inhibition metrics (GI<sub>50</sub>) was reported in [Heiser et al. (2012)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1018854108). Here, the HMS LINCS Center reports the GR metrics for the data."],
